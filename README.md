# Deep-Fake-Image-Detection-
## overview
Deep learning-based media forgery deepfake algorithms have revolutionized the way we create and manipulate digital content. It is an advanced synthetic technique that can replace the person in an existing image with someone elseâ€™s characteristics, allowing users to easily produce realistic looking fake images. To address this problem, researchers proposed several models experimented using different datasets, but this is an open area of research in which many datasets and models can still be manipulated. In this paper, we propose a customized CNN-based model and process a dataset sourced from Kaggle that has never been experimented on by any paper to the best of our knowledge. We compare this model with D-CNN which is a recent model that has the highest accuracy among the other models that we have explored. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art with 96% accuracy and only 0.8% loss.
